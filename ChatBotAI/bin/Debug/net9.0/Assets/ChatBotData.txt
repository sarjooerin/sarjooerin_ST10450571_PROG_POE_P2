# Definitions
phishing | Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate institutions via email, text, or websites to trick individuals into providing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. Always check the sender‚Äôs address and never click on suspicious links. Look for grammatical errors or urgent language, which are common red flags.

scam | A scam is a fraudulent attempt to deceive someone, usually for financial gain. Scammers often impersonate trusted individuals or organizations through email, calls, or messages.

password | A password is a secret string of characters used to verify a user's identity and grant access to digital systems, accounts, or devices. It acts as the first line of defense against unauthorized access.

malware | Malware is short for 'malicious software' and includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. It‚Äôs designed to harm or exploit devices and data. Avoid downloading software from untrusted sources and keep your antivirus software up to date.

ransomware | Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user‚Äôs data and demands payment to restore access. Paying the ransom is not recommended, as it doesn‚Äôt guarantee data recovery. Regular backups and updated security software are the best defenses.

strong password | A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information or common words. Use a password manager to help generate and store strong passwords securely.

two-factor authentication | Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just a password, but also something you have (like a phone for a text code) or something you are (like a fingerprint). Enabling 2FA significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.

social engineering | Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals to gain confidential information. Attackers may pose as trusted figures like IT support or HR. Always verify requests for sensitive information, especially over the phone or via email.

wifi security | Public Wi-Fi networks are often insecure. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or conducting financial transactions on public Wi-Fi. Use a VPN to encrypt your internet connection when on public networks.

update software | Software updates often contain important security patches that fix known vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates whenever possible to ensure your system stays secure.

antivirus software | Antivirus software helps detect and prevent threats like malware. It should be regularly updated to recognize new threats. While it's a crucial defense layer, it's most effective when combined with smart online behavior.

identity theft | Identity theft occurs when someone steals your personal information to commit fraud. Monitor your financial accounts, use strong passwords, and never share personal data unless you‚Äôre certain of the recipient‚Äôs identity.
